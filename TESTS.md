Set the `id` section to the id of an existing Google Sheet.
- Copy the contents of `rules.example.yml` to `rules.yml`.

### Steps
1. Run `npm start` to start the synchronisation agent.
2. Wait a couple of seconds until the initial cold start of the synchronisation process is completed.

### Postconditions
- All the RDF data on the resource should be correctly converted and displayed on the Google Sheet.

## Test if changes on the Google Sheet are synced back to the Pod

### Preconditions
- Follow and execute all steps in the "cold start" test above.

### Steps

2. Wait at least the configured amount of milliseconds as configured under `interval` in the configuration file (default 5000).

### Postconditions
- The changes are correctly converted and written back to the resource `http://localhost:3000/example/software`.

##  Test if changes on the Pod are synced back to the Google Sheet

### Preconditions
- Follow and execute all steps in the "cold start" test above.

### Steps
The pod can be updated with the following request:
```curl
curl --location --request PATCH 'http://localhost:3000/example/software' --header 'Content-Type: text/n3' --data-raw '@prefix solid: <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/terms#>. @prefix software: <https://data.knows.idlab.ugent.be/person/office/software#>. @prefix schema: <http://schema.org/>. _:rename a solid:InsertDeletePatch; solid:inserts { software:test schema:name "test"; schema:description "abracadabra". }.'
```
When using websockets, the change should be almost immediately be shown, 
otherwise wait at least the configured amount of milliseconds (default 5000ms).

### Postconditions
- The changes are correctly converted and visible in the google sheet
