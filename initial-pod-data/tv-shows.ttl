  The Mandalorian is an American space western television series created by Jon Favreau for the streaming service Disney+. 
  It is the first live-action series in the Star Wars franchise, beginning five years after the events of Return of the Jedi (1983), 
  and stars Pedro Pascal as the title character, a lone bounty hunter who goes on the run to protect "the Child". 
  Star Wars creator George Lucas had begun developing a live-action Star Wars television series by 2009, 
  but this project was deemed too expensive to produce. He sold Lucasfilm to Disney in October 2012. Subsequently, 
  work on a new Star Wars series began for Disney+. Favreau signed on in March 2018, serving as writer and showrunner. 
  He executive produces alongside Dave Filoni, Kathleen Kennedy, and Colin Wilson. 
  The series' title was announced in October 2018, with filming starting at Manhattan Beach Studios in California. 
  Visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic developed the StageCraft technology for the series, 
  using virtual sets and a 360-degree video wall to create the series' environments. 
  This has since been adopted by other film and television productions. 
  The Mandalorian premiered with the launch of Disney+ on November 12, 2019. 
  The eight-episode first season was met with positive reviews, was nominated for Outstanding Drama Series at 
  the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards, and won seven Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards. 
  A second season premiered on October 30, 2020, to positive reviews, and a 
  third season is scheduled to premiere on March 1, 2023. A fourth season is in development. 
  Interconnected spin-off series The Book of Boba Fett, Ahsoka, and Skeleton Crew expand on The Mandalorian's timeframe.
