# Tests

## Test the "cold start" of the Pod to Google Sheet synchronisation

### Preconditions

- Run `npm run prepare:pods` to prepare a local
  [Community Solid Server](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer).
- Run `npm run start:pods` to start the local CSS.
- Make sure correct tokens have been generated by following the authentication steps as described in `README.md`
  in sections `Google Sheet API` and `OAuth2 tokens`.
- Copy the contents of `config.query.example.yml` to `config.yml` in the working directory.
  Set the `id` section to the id of an existing Google Sheet.
- Copy the contents of `rules.example.yml` to `rules.yml`.

### Steps

1. Run `npm start` to start the synchronisation agent.
2. Wait a couple of seconds until the initial cold start of the synchronisation process is completed.

### Postconditions

- All the RDF data on the resource should be correctly converted and displayed on the Google Sheet.

## Test if changes on the Google Sheet are synced back to the Pod

### Preconditions

- Follow and execute all steps in the "cold start" test above.

### Steps

1. Change and/or delete any amount of cells in the Google Sheet. Do not delete an entire row.
2. Wait at least the configured amount of milliseconds as configured under `interval`
   in the configuration file (default 5000).

### Postconditions

- The resource `http://localhost:3000/testing/software` contains the new data.

## Test if changes on the Pod are synced back to the Google Sheet

### Preconditions

- Follow and execute all steps in the "cold start" test above.

### Steps

The pod can be updated with the following request:

```shell
curl --location --request PATCH 'http://localhost:3000/testing/software' --header 'Content-Type: text/n3' --data-raw '@prefix solid: <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/terms#>. @prefix software: <https://data.knows.idlab.ugent.be/person/office/software#>. @prefix schema: <http://schema.org/>. _:rename a solid:InsertDeletePatch; solid:inserts { software:test schema:name "test"; schema:description "abracadabra". }.'
```

When using websockets, the change should be almost immediately shown,
otherwise wait at least the configured amount of milliseconds (default 5000ms).

### Postconditions

- The Google sheet contains the new data.

## Test if authentication works correctly

### Preconditions

- Go to `initial-pod-data/software.acl` and change `acl:agentClass foaf:Agent;`
  to `acl:agentClass acl:AuthenticatedAgent;`.
  This makes the resource only accessible for authenticated Agents.
- Make sure all dependencies have been installed by running `npm i`.
- Run `npm run prepare:pods` to prepare a local
    [Community Solid Server](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer).
- Run `npm run start:pods` to start the local CSS.
- Make sure correct tokens have been generated by following the authentication steps as described in `README.md`
  in sections `Google Sheet API` and `OAuth2 tokens`.
- Copy the contents of `config.query.example.yml` to `config.yml` in the working directory.
  Set the `id` section to the id of an existing Google Sheet.
- Copy the contents of `rules.example.yml` to `rules.yml`.

### Steps

1. Run `npm run auth` to start the authentication web app.
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:8081/` (or another port if changed) in a browser.
3. Fill in all the necessary information:
   - host server (Url of your [Community Solid Server](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer)
  where your pod is located)
   - email for your pod
   - password for your pod

   The Solid instance that comes with this program is seeded with 1 pod by default. The default pod name is `example`.
  The email is `hello@example.com` with password `abc123`. You can use these values to authenticate. For the host value,
  use `http://localhost:3000`.
4. Press "Authenticate" under the "Solid Pod" section.
5. Run `npm start` to start the synchronisation agent.
6. Wait a couple of seconds until the initial cold start of the synchronisation process is completed.

### Postconditions

If authentication was done correctly and successfully, everything should work the same as without authentication.

## Test a setup using multiple sources

### Preconditions

- Make sure all dependencies have been installed by running `npm i`.
- Run `npm run prepare:pods` to prepare a local
  [Community Solid Server](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer).
- Run `npm run start:pods` to start the local CSS.
- Make sure correct tokens have been generated by following the authentication steps as described in `README.md`
  in sections `Google Sheet API` and `OAuth2 tokens`.
- Copy the contents of `config.query-multiple.example.yml` to `config.yml` in the working directory.
  Set the `id` section to the id of an existing Google Sheet.
- Copy the contents of `rules-multiple.example.yml` to `rules.yml`.

### Steps

1. Run `npm start` to start the synchronisation agent.
2. You can change the `description`, `score`, `reviewDate` and `title` of tv-shows

### Postconditions

Depending on the column that you edit, the corresponding file will be changed as well.
The columns `description` and `title` are stored in `pods/testing/tv-shows$.ttl`,
`score` and `reviewDate` are stored in `pods/testing/ratings$.ttl`.

The other columns are the IRIs of the objects (the identifiers).
You can change these but it is generally not a good idea, since new objects will be created.
