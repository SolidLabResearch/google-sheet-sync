# Tests

## Test the "cold start" of the Pod to Google Sheet synchronisation

### Setup cold start

- Run `npm run prepare:pods` to prepare a local
[Community Solid Server](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer).
- Run `npm run start:pods` to start the local CSS.
- Make sure correct tokens have been generated by following the authentication
steps as described in `README.md` in sections `Google Sheet API`
and `OAuth2 tokens`.
- Copy the contents of `config.query.example.yml` to `config.yml` in the
working directory. Set the `id` section to the id of an existing Google Sheet.
- Copy the contents of `rules.example.yml` to `rules.yml`.

### Steps to perform cold start

1. Run `npm start` to start the synchronisation agent.
2. Wait a couple of seconds until the initial cold start of
the synchronisation process is completed.

### Result of cold start test

- All the RDF data on the resource should be correctly converted
and displayed on the Google Sheet.

## Test if changes on the Google Sheet are synced back to the Pod

### Preconditions to test sheet => pod sync

- Follow and execute all steps in the "cold start" test above.

### Steps to test sheet => pod sync

1. Change and/or delete any amount of cells in the Google Sheet.
Do not delete an entire row.
2. Wait at least the configured amount of milliseconds as configured
under `interval` in the configuration file (default 5000).

### Result of sheet => pod sync test

- The resource `http://localhost:3000/example/software` contains the new data.

## Test if changes on the Pod are synced back to the Google Sheet

### Setup to test pod => sheet sync

- Follow and execute all steps in the "cold start" test above.

### Steps to test pod => sheet sync

The pod can be updated with the following request:

```shell
curl --location --request PATCH "http://localhost:3000/example/software" \
--header "Content-Type: text/n3" \
--data-raw "@prefix solid: <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/terms#>.
@prefix software: <https://data.knows.idlab.ugent.be/person/office/software#>.
@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/>.
_:rename a solid:InsertDeletePatch;
solid:inserts 
{ software:test schema:name \"test\"; schema:description \"abracadabra\". }."
```

When using websockets, the change should be almost immediately shown,
otherwise wait at least the configured amount of milliseconds (default 5000ms).

### Result of pod => sheet sync

- The Google sheet contains the new data.
